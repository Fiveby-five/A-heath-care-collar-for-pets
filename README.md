# A-heath-care-collar-for-pets
I designed a collar to invigilate the health situation of your pets. Including BPM , SPO2 , temperature , steps and more. It could be podcast and control by a remoter.
I use ESP32C3 module to develop these. Including two c3. One is install inside of the collar. Another one as the remoter and also reciever. 
Actually this project is originally made for guide dog. So I design a voice speaker for it. And also a liner motor to produce vibration.
This program is still working on.
The machine design and PCB will be uploaded later.
